def fizzbuzz(n):
    """This function takes an integer n, and checks if it is divisible by 3
    divisible by 5 or divisible by both 3 and 5. If n is divisible by 3, the 
    function should return the string 'fizz'. If n is divisible by 5, the function
    should return the string 'buzz'. If n is divisible by both 3 and 5, the
    function should return the string 'fizzbuzz'. If n is not divisible by 3
    or 5, the function should return the empty string.
    Hint: 0 is divisible by both 3 and 5.

    Parameters

    n : int
