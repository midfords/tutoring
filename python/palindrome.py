def isPalindrome(l):
    """This function takes a string s, and checks if it is a palindrome. A palindrome
    is any word (or sentance) such that the first and second halves are exactly mirrored.
    For example 'racecar' is a palindrome since the first half of the string 'rac' is
    equal to the second half of the string 'car' reversed.
    An empty string is always a palindrome.
    Example 1: "racecar" -> True  because the first half of the string 'rac' is equal
        to the second half of the string 'car' reversed.
    Example 2: "" -> True  because an empty string is always a palindrome
    Example 3: "something" -> False  because the first half of the string 'some' does
        not equal the second half of the string 'hing' reversed.

    Parameters
    ----------
    s : str
        The string to be checked.
    
    Returns
    -------
    bool
        True if the string is a palindrome, otherwise False.
