def sort_even_odd(l):
    """This function takes a list of numbers l, and splits the numbers into three sublists. One list containing all even numbers, one list containing all odd numbers, and one list containing all zeros. The three lists are returned as a tuple. Numbers must remain in the same order after sorting (For example, the odd numbers in the list [1, 2, 3] must appear as [1, 3], and not as [3, 1])

    Example 1: [0, 1, 2, 3] -> ([2], [0], [1, 3])  The numbers are sorted into three lists
    Example 2: [] -> ([], [], [])  There are no numbers to be sorted, so we return three
        empty lists.

    Parameters
    ----------
    l : list
        The list to be sorted.

    Returns
    -------
    tuple
        The tuple containing the three sublists.
