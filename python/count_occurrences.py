def count_occurrences(l, e):
    """This function takes a list l and some value e. The function should count how many instances
        of e are in the list and return the count. The list can contain anything, and e can be anything.

    Example 1: [1, "Hi", 3.1415, False, 1], 1 -> 2  There are two instances of '1' in the list, 
        so we return 2.
    Example 2: [None, "abc", 3.0], True -> 0  There are no instances of 'True' in the list, 
        so we return 0
    Example 3: [], 1 -> 0  The list is empty, so we return 0

    Parameters
    ----------
    l : list
        The list of items to be counted.
    e : obj
        The item to count.
