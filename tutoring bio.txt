Professional tutoring services for students or employees in the Ottawa/Gatineau area.

I am an experienced software engineer with 10+ years of programming experience. I hold an Hon.B.Sc. in Computer Science and have worked at some of the most prestigious companies in the world including Amazon, Facebook and Google. I can help with computer science undergrad courses, personal development and technical interview preparation.

I have a strong background in tutoring, including 8+ years of teaching private lessons, as well as employment as a teacher's assistant at the University of Manitoba for introductory computer courses.

Common topics I cover are basic programming, object-oriented programming, algorithms and data structures, large application design, databases (relational and non-relational), testing, human computer interaction, mobile development, and web development. I mainly teach programming in the following languages: Java, Python, JavaScript, C/C++, C#.
