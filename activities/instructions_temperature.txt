0. Make a new file and call it temp.py
1. Make a variable called tempC and have it receive a value from the input function. (Hint: Make sure to wrap the input function in a float function, so we get a decimal number from it).
2. Make a varaible called tempF and set it to equal the following math code:
        tempC * 1.8 + 32
3. Print the tempF variable
